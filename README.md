# Ryerson Big Data Capstone Project
# DeepThreat: Detecting Threats on 3D Body Model for Security in Airports Using Deep Learning

## Project Abstract

### Overview

This is Casptone Project in the certificate program of Ryerson Uiversity Big Data Analytics certificate program.

The project attempts to classify threat and regions in a body using 3D sccaned image from airport security. A build model will be construct from a 3d data using machine learning and classifiers like decision-tree.
